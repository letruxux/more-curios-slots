> ## WARNING!! This mod, like the [Curios](https://modrinth.com/mod/curios) mod, requires other supported mods to work. It won't do much by itself. If you don't know any, try [Artifacts](https://modrinth.com/mod/artifacts) or [Unique Accessories](https://modrinth.com/mod/unique-accessories).


This mod allows you to craft more slots to use with Curios. They are pricey, but worth it.

You can edit the crafting recipes with KubeJS or datapacks. Curios uses tags like `#curios:charm`, `#curios:head` etc. to refer to items that fit in a specific slot.

## Troubleshooting
> "This slot is not available in your modpack! It will be useless."

\> This means you don't have any mod that uses curios. Read the first part of this page.

> When using artifacts, effects don't stack.

\> This is just how artifacts is programmed, pretty sad. It theoretically would be possible to change this behavior via mixins, but i'm not experienced enough yet.
